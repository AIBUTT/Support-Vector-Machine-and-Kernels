# Support-Vector-Machine-and-Kernels
This is a completed project for Machine Learning: Algorithms in Real World Specialization offered by Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute.

In this notebook, we fit a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifer to data using Scikit-Learn. We used different kernels and observed how kernels produce nonlinear decision surfaces. We also predicted the labels for datapoints and measured the performance of the SVM.
